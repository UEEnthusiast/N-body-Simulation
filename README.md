# N-body-Simulation


Using Unreal’s data structures and game framework, implement an N-body Simulation as a real-time 2D visual
experience. Render the Bodies as filled circles flying across the screen. If a Body flies over the screen’s edge, it
should teleport to the opposite edge and continue its motion, effectively “wrapping” around the game world
and preventing any Bodies from disappearing.
